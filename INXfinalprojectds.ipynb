    "### In machine learning and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for four reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by users\n",
    "- shorter training times\n",
    "- to avoid the curse of dimensionality\n",
    "- enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting\n",
